Implement Insertion Sort and return intermediate states.

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time, from left to right. It works by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.

Objective:
Given a list of key-value pairs, sort the list by key using Insertion Sort. Return a list of lists showing the state of the array after each insertion. If two key-value pairs have the same key, maintain their relative order in the sorted list.

Input:
pairs - a list of key-value pairs, where each key-value has an integer key and a string value. (0 <= pairs.length <= 100).

# Solution
# Definition for a pair.
# class Pair:
#     def __init__(self, key: int, value: str):
#         self.key = key
#         self.value = value
class Solution:
    # Implementation of Insertion Sort
    def insertionSort(self, pairs: List[Pair]) -> List[List[Pair]]:
        n = len(pairs)
        res = []  # To store the intermediate states of the array
        
        for i in range(n):
            j = i - 1

            # Move elements that are greater than key one position ahead
            while j >= 0 and pairs[j].key > pairs[j + 1].key:
                pairs[j], pairs[j + 1] = pairs[j + 1], pairs[j]
                j -= 1
            
            # Clone and save the entire state of the array at this point
            res.append(pairs[:])

        return res
